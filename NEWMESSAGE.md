Hello all users,

Pal is down, and will be continued to be off for a couple of days. We are trying to figure out what to do, but we have no luck.
As you may already know, this is a **project**, not just a bot.
So if the project fails, we have all access to terminate the bot.

Hopefully, it does not come to that. However, we are in need of bot testers. These people will be asked for just a few days to test 'Pal'.
This is a volenteer system, there is 0% reward for any work you do.

Thank you,
The Team
