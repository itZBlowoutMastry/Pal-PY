# Pal-PY
Pal in Python, a advancing bot for discord users. One that has certainly captured attention of most. Mainly used and hosted using Python, and Yarn.  FORKING THE CODE CAN AND WILL GET YOU COPYRIGHT STRIKED

** This bot is kinda OP **

What features it has in V 2.0:

Faster Cog Loadup Commands

- Better Moderation command responses
- Fixed an error on p?ban (User) (reason), where it can now DM users (Error Code Fixed: "Cannot send messages to this user")
Code has now been changed to await ctx.author.send followed by, ban.
- Fixed an error on p?warn (user) (reason) where you must use quotation marks for your message which is longer than 1 word (used * variable on await ctx)
- Fixed an error on p?say (message.content) where you must use quotation marks for a message more than 1 word long (used * variable on await ctx)

Bugs to fix:

- p?help command (disable help code command fixed) error on message
- p?off (DEV ONLY) response to p?on, late (10000ms slower than it should be)
